1- Parse access.log files and extract all information :
    Read file --> get ips --> show what are the ips and their appearences
    # add more features (parse more)

2- Directory monitoring :
    # check creation --> not done
    # check deletion --> keeps giving notification until you stop 

3- It will scan a range of IPs [TCP & UDP]. after gaining the open ports,
 pass them to Nmap with -sC -sV options and parse the output to the user.
 	# and mesh rady 3an el ana 3amlo (bas mekasel) ***** 
 	# port open --> nmap on this port (should gather them and send them to nmap 1 time only bas el 7asal)
 	# this makes the scanner very very slow and needs threading
 	

4- Attack detection [listen to unknown ports and check if there is someone
try to connect], send a mail and block the IP [Block using iptc module to
add in iptables]
	# didnot send the mail
	# tested on local environment

5- Parse any link and extract all tags, comments, domains, subdomains
and full URLs from it.
	# extract all tags 	 --> done (not unique , just all with order)
	# extract comments	 --> done
	# extract domains	 --> 
	# extract subdomains -->
	# extract Full URLs  --> got all links in <a> tag
